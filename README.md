# My Todo app

This is my first app based on React, using the Vite bundler. It can be used for making a list of tasks which you can tick as done and delete.

## To get started:
- Type `yarn` to install all dependencies. 
- Type `yarn dev` to run project in the development mode.
- Type `yarn build` to run project in the production mode.
